Chatanooga 1.1 - AI Chatbot

Chatanooga is an AI chatbot designed to interact with users using both speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. 
It uses the DialoGPT language model for generating responses and is primarily built in Python 3.7.4. 
This project provides a conversational interface that can be customized and extended based on specific requirements.
